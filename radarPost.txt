<p>It was costing $0.003 per result. Even <a href="http://www.shareapps.net" rel="nofollow">www.shareapps.net</a> which I squeezed cost NGN1.50k per view<br>$0.003 is 60kobo. <br>I used a video <a href="https://instagram.com/p/94DU5jwnGu/" rel="nofollow">https://instagram.com/p/94DU5jwnGu/</a> for the ad and you can go see the actual number of people who actually click Like on the video.<br>Anybody will tell you that the hardest thing to sell is a recharge website or app because everybody already has a preferred source.<br>Over the period we ran this ad at $5/day, we tracked 90downloads/day of which averagely 25 made a purchase.<br>Considering that instagram is for only smartphone users, I think every startup should go there.<br>This is my Nigerian specific ad target. I got the similar results for North America and Europe while The rest of African Countries Targeted ad was $0.002/view.(40kobo)</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>TWITTER<br>Twitter always hurts because it is expensive in every direction. <br>Below is a screenshot from some tests. As you can see, I targeting different people sets.<br>Gossip handles – That was an ad targeting followers of linda, bellanaija etc.<br>Newsmedia handles target - nigerianewsdesk, punchng vanguard etc<br>Ecommerce handles tagrte was for followers of jumia, konga etc.<br>I also did one for the music industry (followers of wizkid, Don jazzy etc.) and the telcos (<span class="mention">@mtnng</span>, <span class="mention">@airtelnigeria</span> <span class="mention">@globacomlimited</span> and <span class="mention">@etisalat_9ja</span>)</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

<p>The primary reason I add this to my R&amp;D work at Coremobile is to drive advertising because I am typically the empirical data guy.<br>On twitter, I have given up and we now use the Handshake Algorithm which has been delivering 200followers everyday consistently at NGN40,000/month. I wrote about it a while back.</br></p>
<p>I think its important for companies (Big or Small) to get the best out of every money they spend. Instagram is killing it for smartphone consumers targeted ad right now. 60kobo per ad view is greatness.</p>

<p>This post right here deserves a superlike or two likes. Thanks for the insight. It is threads/topics like this that we need. I have more questions to ask you, but I haven't fully read your post. I just skimmed through it. Also by the way, weren't you the same person who had that bulk sms app? You never answered my questions. Whats up?</p>

<p>Before or after you tried targeting Nigeria specifically, did Instagram by any chance give you an estimate of how many users in Nigeria (or Africa in general) use their service? Any statistics? If so, do you mind sharing?</p>

<p>Very nice. Do you by any chance have any more important data insights (similar to this) that you will like to share? As in how many Nigerians actually use the internet daily? How many Nigerians actually use dumb/feature or smart phones? Also how many Nigerians still send/receive sms compared to Whatsapp?</p>

<p>It's simple when the big guns comes barging in with their tens of thousand of dollars. Instagram would be forced to increase their CPI, and other ads measuring metrics. Same also happened with Facebook and Twitter...</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/davidsmith8900">@davidsmith8900</a> I was trying not to talk too much about the Bulksms App because the post was about another App. Yes we have API for the app but we are yet to complete reliability simulations on it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/users/ribads">@ribads</a> is right that as more people hit instagram advertising, the cost will go up. I think the reason why its cheaper in places like other African countries is probably nobody is advertising on it.</p>
<p>Also, instagram will give you the number of Nigerian users. Another great thing about Instagram is that it does not use IP address but it uses the user country profile. SO even though my family were not in Nigeria at the time, they were seeing the ad on their IG. This is really helpful for those of us that run ads in different languages targeting different countries. Also, it will let you know how many android and iphone users. So if your app is android, you can target only Android app users without wasting revenue on iphone users. You can find out more about it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1443935649245791" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>For feature phones, I find <a href="http://www.shareapps.net" rel="nofollow">www.shareapps.net</a> or similar platforms more useful.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/users/davidsmith8900">@davidsmith8900</a> There is a lot of info to share but finding time is hard. I try to make a conscious effort to share once a quarter.</p>

<p>Personally, the number of services I have come to be aware of and benefit from through Instagram trumps any other digital service I know. A reinforcement of the saying that "A picture/video speaks louder than a thousand words".</p>
<p>Already, MUAs, Wedding Photographers, Fashion Bloggers, Foodie services  etc are already raking in their profits by the thousands and millions, time the tech startup ecosys do same too.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/ogunlanaolumide">@ogunlanaolumide</a> You sound like one of those guys in my high school who would report me to the maths teacher for allowing my mates to dub.<br>There is nothing like competition in B2C. You are screaming too hard.<br>Let me share something with you about your market potential.</br></br></p>
<p>Below is my personal empirical market potential formula which i use for my projects;</p>
<p>Annual potential market Size = [Cr * (Mc) * (1 + Gr/100)] + [Ic * Cr * (0.7) * (Mc)]<br>The first component is the percentage of the growth market you can capture, while the second component is how many of the existing maket you can wrestle from competitors.<br>Where;<br>Cr = Challenge ratio - (The ratio of your advertising budget to the total advertising budget of all your competition)<br>Mc = Actual market size<br>Gr = market growth rate in percentage points<br>Ic = Infrastructure coefficient (the number of possible infrastructure channels offered versus the potential available infrastructural support.<br>Eg. Payment channels - mastercard, visa, verve, paypal, google wallet, bank transfer, gtpay, Delivery channels - website, mobile site, android app, blackberry10 app, blackberry 6/7 app, windows app, iphone app, ipad app etc)<br>Cc = Competition coefficient<br>NOTE: I used global customer retention factor of 30% in arriving at the 0.7. There are studies which state that 30% of the market are very resistant to change. Those are the people who only buy flat screen Tvs because they can't find CRT any more (Quote by Simon Sinek.)<br>So there you see it a combination of several factors that affect your success.<br>It all depends on how you want to sleep. Don't ever be scared of sharing information. You learn more when you share.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/users/sugabelly">@sugabelly</a> <a href="https://business.instagram.com/advertising/" rel="nofollow">https://business.instagram.com/advertising/</a><br>You would have to be very patient in going through your first instagram ad setup. After the first two, you would find it easier.</br></p>

<p>Nice analysis. I think you can get more by working on the video. But I doubt the ad led to the downloads because there is no link at the end of the video. What I did was to like it and I moved on.  For most people promoting apps on Instagram, once you click on the image, it takes you straight to the app store or is there another ad that you ran? But you promoted a video, so it could have been Google Play traffic  because your seo seems quite okay. </p>
<p>But great work with the advertising. </p>
<p>For users outside Nigeria, do they pay via PayPal? <br>Are you using a merchant account for this? I'm quite interested in this <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" src="/images/emoji/apple/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:"/></br></p>

It usually includes a "download" on the botttom right under the video. <br>Actually, during my research and even in full mode, we usually include a link from google analytics to track my effectiveness.<br>Outside Nigeria, we have a different pack running.

<p>Lmao....You might as well share your customer database while at it..<br>Its obvious you don't know the consequence of what you have done. Allow me explain.</br></p>
<p>Whenever there is a new ad product, if properly executed, the results are great, until it becomes crowded with more advertisers. The more the advertisers, the higher the bidding, the less effective it is for you. At a point only the giants would be able to afford it.</p>
<p>Even without your post I am not saying this would not eventually happen, however, putting up your screenshot on radar (for insights clients pay for) is only accelerating the process.</p>
<p>You might as well carry a mic and scream : "Guys this is where am getting all my downloads (customers) from oo..Join me in competing for users attention by bidding higher than me..I love to share on radar cause it makes me look sexy"</p>

<p>Work hard in silence, let your success be your noise. AGREED!</p>
<p>Calm down <a class="mention" href="/users/ogunlanaolumide">@ogunlanaolumide</a>; it might interest you to know that sharing business data can also be an advantage.<br>Coopetition Leads to Crowd-Sourced Intelligence.</br></p>
<p>“When companies that would normally be at each other’s throats, suddenly start cooperating, they like to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/17/the-spirit-of-coopetition-is-alive-and-well-in-the-cloud/" rel="nofollow">call it coopetition</a>,” says TechCrunch. “You could call it being frenemies, but whatever you call it, these companies are coming together in seemingly greater numbers —and the customers are the beneficiaries.”  </p>
<p>Consumers and customers don’t really care about competition; they just want products to work well together and they want to benefit from increased transparency into why one business can be trusted more than another. Since even companies who wish to compete with each other can’t get access to all the data they need on their own to meet these demands, they are increasingly looking for ways to connect through coopetition.   </p>
<p>Investing in the connections among team members both increases productivity and reduces risks. In this case Radar. If only you knew the loop-holes other folks could divulge to <a class="mention" href="/users/uduak">@Uduak</a> which he could implement and increase his conversion, insights which he could not not otherwise access, which will in turn put his product one-step ahead?</p>
<p>The sharing economy is upon us and is growing. Take the back-seat or drive angry. #PunIntended</p>
